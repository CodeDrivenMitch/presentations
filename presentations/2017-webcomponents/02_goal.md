# Goal

Understanding the Shadow DOM and how to test components using it

Note:

For this presentation I want to set a clear goal and I would like to achieve that together with you. 
That goal is understanding how the Shadow DOM works, why it breaks our test tools and how we can fix that!

_Question:_ So let me ask you, how many of you are using a Shadow DOM in your app? (So that includes Polymer 2 and native webcomponents with Shadow DOMs)

_Optional Question:_ How many of those who said no, are using webcomponents without Shadow DOMs?
