Note: 
Well, I got something for everyone tonight, from the basics to deeper understanding. We will take a look at all parts of the problem we are having when E2E-testing webcomponents

For starters, we will talk about E2E-testing. What it is and why you should use it. 

We will then take a look at what Polymer provides on top of vanilla webcomponents, and how the difference looks in code. 

Thirdly, I will talk about what the Shadow DOM means, or can mean for you, and show you how using it works.

After that I will talk about the problems we face when combining Shadow DOM and e2e-tests. 

Afterwards I can answer some of your questions! But if you have a really pressing question, don't hestitate to raise your hand during the presentation itself.
