### Why do we want to do that?

1. Pay for what you use
2. Did I mention scalability before?
3. Easy encryption and data safety
4. Make the first move towards serverless architecture


--- 

### Costs and Usage

- Current MongoDB servers are expensive, and barely used
- At the same time not very scalable
- Costs focused on Storage, not good for Big Data


---

### Scalability
- Easy scalability with DynamoDB
- Just adjust a number in the console!
- Infrastructure as code

---

### Encryption
- DynamoDB provides out-of-the-box encryption with KMS
- Clients of Gareth require security measures

--- 
### Serverless
- No more servers to maintain
- Pay for what you use
